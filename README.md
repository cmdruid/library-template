# Library Template

This is a template project to get you started with developing a typescript library. 

This template includes a minimal development environment, which covers:

- Linting (using typescript and eslint)
- Testing (using tape)
- Building (using rollup and tsc)
- Deploying (with best-practice package.json)

The scripts in package.json are also very useful, and will help you with building and deploying your package to npm.

The rollup configuration will give you a commonjs, esm, and minified browser (iife) distribution, with properly configured types and source maps.

The typescript configuration will also give you path aliases for your `/src` directory (as `@/`).

Any questions or issues, please let me know!
